# Calculator
 
## Java simple calculator program with GUI

Calculator built with Java programming language using Java Swing and Java AWT, two graphics libraries provided by Java for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

Java AWT is Java's first graphics library, which uses the native components of the underlying operating system, while Java Swing is a newer and customizable graphics library that provides additional and portable graphics components.

## Details
The program consists of a Calculator class, which extends with the implementation of the ActionListener interface.

The calculator has numbers from 0 to 9 and some basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
There are also buttons for deleting the last character, deleting all entered text and inverting the sign of the current value.

The code uses a number of Swing components, such as JFrame, JTextField, JButton and JPanel, to create the graphical interface of the calculator.
To use the calculator, simply start the application and click on the number and operation buttons, or enter the numbers directly and press the button corresponding to the desired operation. The result of the operation will be displayed in the text field.

The font "Montserrat" with size 30 was used for the buttons and the text field.

The code was designed to be simple and easy to understand, but you can modify and customize it as you like.
